## WOptiPNG - simple GUI for OptiPNG. ##

This is a very [basic GUI](http://i.imgur.com/rCn21iA.png) for [OptiPNG](http://optipng.sourceforge.net/) optimizer. It's similar to the other awesome project - [PNGGauntlet](http://pnggauntlet.com/), except that one is a lot more mature and "closed-source". 

I just wanted to play with WPF and [MahApps.Metro](http://mahapps.com) a bit and happened to need an OptiPNG-only GUI. You probably shouldn't use this code for learning. Or for anything at all, really.

.NET 4.5 is required, which means it won't run on Windows XP. Would look quite weird anyway.

The name is terrible because I'm terrible at naming.
